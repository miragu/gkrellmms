GKrellMMS FAQ:
--------------

This file answers some commonly asked questions.
If you've got a problem installing gkrellmms, please first read this file
before mailing me.

Please, before mailing me, check your versions of GKrellM and XMMS.
You can check your own versions by calling 'gkrellm --version' and 'xmms
--version' in a shell.

-----

Q: When I open GKrellMMS, it freezes for about half a minute, and then
   continues fine.

A: You'll probably have set that GKrellMMS should load the entire
   playlist-info while loading a new playlist.
   You can unset this by doing these things:
   In the gkrellmms-config-window, in the Switches-tab, set the 'Load
   file-info:' to 'On File play only'.
   After that, go to the XMMS Preferences-window, to the Options-tab. Unset
   both toggles from the 'Read info on'.

-----

Q: GKrellMMS segfaults when I try to open an mp3-file from it.

A: The eject-button in GKrellMMS can be set to open a playlist or other
   files. It defaults to open a playlist. If you try to open an mp3 while
   trying to open a playlist, it segfaults (oops). You can change this action
   in the GKrellMMS-config window, in the Switches-tab. Set 'Eject-button
   opens:' to 'File(s)' instead of 'Playlist', and it works.

Q: When I run make, I get this message (or something familiar):

   In file included from gkrellmms.c:21:
   gkrellmms.h:21: gkrellm2/gkrellm.h: No such file or directory

A: You'll have to install the newest gkrellm, and have installed the
   gkrellm-header files to your includes-dir (normally /usr/include or
   /usr/local/include)
   You can get gkrellm at: http://gkrellm.net

-----

Q: When I run make, I get this message (or something familiar):

   /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lxmms

A: You'll probably have installed xmms from a package; you'll also have to
   install the xmms-devel package.

-----

Q: When I run make, I get this message (or something familiar):

   gkrellmms.h:22: xmms/xmmsctrl.h: No such file or directory

A: You'll have to install the xmms-devel package as well as the standard
   xmms-package.

-----

Q: gkrellmms doesn't start, and in gkrellm's plugin-log shows up:

   Error: /usr/lib/libxmms.so.1: undefined symbol: XF86VidModeSetViewPort

A: This isn't a bug from gkrellmms, but from the xmms/X packages (I guess).
   You can try to fix this by uninstalling xmms-devel, removing
   /usr/lib/libxmms.*, and re-installing xmms-devel. I don't know if this
   solution works for everybody; I didn't get this error myself, but I
   know some people with which it worked.

-----

Q: I've got a segfault somewhere.

A: Mail it to me!
   Please include some info about the bug (when you got it, what versions of
   gkrellm, xmms and gkrellmms you use, etc...) when mailing me.
